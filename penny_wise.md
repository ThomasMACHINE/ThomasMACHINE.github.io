# PennyWise
A project in the module Game Programming. Collaborated in a group of 4 to create a game using the Game Engine, Unity. Below is a video of the gameplay, showcasing features within the game. The repository is available with a more comprensive README found [here](https://github.com/ThomasMACHINE/PennyWise).

## Reflections
As part of the submission of the project, I made my own reflections. This reflection is much longer and can be found [here](https://github.com/ThomasMACHINE/PennyWise/blob/master/Assets/IndividualReports/Thomas.md).

As I had some previous experience in Unity when the project was initialized, I was able to play the role as the facilitator of the team. Unity is a large application with many intricasies, 
not only within the application itself, but also in the Library provided to write programs for it. I was able to accelerate the start-phase of the project by providing detailed explenations
and videos showcasing how to use it. During the 4 months of development I had produced 33 videos where I would show and talk about different aspects of unity, two of them can be found here about creating animations:
