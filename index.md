# Hello World!

Welcome to my page! I am a Software Engineer from Norway that has been living in the UK since 2020. I hold a Pre-Settled status which means that I am able to work and live in the UK without any restrictions.

During my Degree I have been a part of many interesting projects, showcasing and reflections can be found on the links below.
