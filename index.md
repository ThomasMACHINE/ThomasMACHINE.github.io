# Final Year Project - Patient Simulations for Educating Medicine Students in Norway

## The Challenge
Medical education requires a large amount of practical training and is currently almost exclusively in-person. This is particularly resource demanding. Whilst more students are admitted to universities, the hospitals still have a limited capacity for practical training. This causes group sizes to increase and amount of training per student to decrease.

## Solution Angle

Create a digital platform that can subsidise the quantity of in-person clinic training. Worked in a group consisting of three members, consulting for [ZimmerDigital](https://zimmerdigital.no) to create a VR tool that Medicine Students could use to practice patient consultations anywhere and at any time. 

### Producing Simulations - From Hard Coding to Application

In the demo that the client showed us, simulations were hardcoded. This required the developers to cover a large range of skill-sets:

1. Game Design - strong knowledge of designing games within the Unity Editor
2. Programming - strong knowledge c# and the Unity Framework
3. Medicine knowledge to create a scenario and predict outcomes from interactions like: blood tests, temperature readings and testing of reflexes

### Old Work Process

1. The Medicine expert creates a large diagram on expected outcomes from every interaction and hands it over to the programmer.

2. The Programmer make instances out of existing software that fits the criteria of the diagram.

3. The Game Designer creates a copy of a pre-existing scene, and gets to work assigning variables within the game editor.

While being heavily reliant on eachother, step 2 and 3 can take a long time. On a small simulation it might take several hours for each step, on larger simulations it could be several working days. Resulting in a simulation requiring a week or more of development time.

### New Work Process

To increase the speed of developing simulations, we implemented a new framework on how interactions worked within the game.

# The framework

The framework was based around tools being used to complete actions within the game.

1. A tool can hold many actions
2. An action can hold many results
3. Results are activated when the action it resides on is activated

1. The action has an activation function
2.
